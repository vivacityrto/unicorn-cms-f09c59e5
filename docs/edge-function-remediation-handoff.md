# Edge Function remediation handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Purpose:** one shared working record for Codex and Claude Code while
reconciling production Edge Functions with repository source. This is not a
retirement checklist.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Work in a dedicated git worktree. Never switch the shared checkout.
- Do not deploy, retire, delete, or replace an Edge Function merely because it
  is absent from `src/`, missing from `supabase/functions`, or quiet in recent
  logs.
- Before a production change, open a focused PR containing the exact source to
  be deployed. After deploy, record the deployed version and verification in
  that PR/audit entry.
- Preserve request and response contracts unless the task explicitly says
  otherwise. Auth/CORS hardening must not remove an operator workflow.
- Update this file before starting a task and after completing it: owner,
  branch/PR, status, evidence, and any newly discovered dependency.

## Current production/PR baseline

| Item | State | Owner | Required next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR #323 — `assign-package-to-tenant` | Open; production currently returns 410 | Codex | Do not merge until direct workflow/external-caller verification confirms retirement is safe or a supported replacement is supplied. |
| PR #324 — `backfill-vimeo-durations` | Open; secure UI-compatible version is deployed | Codex | Review contract against Academy Builder, check CI, then request Carl's explicit merge approval. |
| PR #325 — deployment-drift audit | Open; documentation only | Codex | Check/fix CI and request Carl's explicit merge approval. |
| UUID stubs `e77f4567-…`, `dcd6c745-…`, `c22daa64-…` | HTTP 410, no credentials | None | Leave unchanged; already documented. |

## Codex workstream — workflow safety and focused hardening

| ID | Task | Status | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Verify the lifecycle of `assign-package-to-tenant` | In progress | Confirm every real caller/replacement, including any operator or external caller. Record evidence. No merge or further production change without positive verification. |
| C2 | Validate `backfill-vimeo-durations` | In progress | Confirm the Academy Builder request contract (`batchSize` and result fields), Super Admin gate, bounded server-side work, and deployed-version/source match. |
| C3 | Capture and harden `test-mailgun` | Pending | First preserve exact live source in a focused PR. Then replace wildcard CORS with the shared request-aware helper without changing Super Admin diagnostic behavior or email request shape. |
| C4 | Verify `academy-backfill-course-thumbnails` workflow | Pending | Identify/use the real Super Admin workflow before lifecycle changes. If retained, capture source and propose bounded batch + scoped CORS as a separate, behavior-preserving PR. |
| C5 | Platform advisor follow-up | Pending | Separate application fixes from console/provider tasks: Postgres security patch level, OTP expiry, and `pg_net` schema exposure. Document any item requiring Carl/Supabase dashboard action. |

## Claude Code workstream — source reconciliation, no lifecycle changes

**Constraint:** Claude captures and compares source only. It must not retire or
deploy a function in this workstream. Open small PRs grouped by compatible
runtime/shared-helper dependencies.

| ID | Deployed function(s) | Status | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `get-email-status`, `report-delivery-issue`, `invite-to-tenant`, `schedule-task-reminders` | Pending | Pull exact deployed source; add it under `supabase/functions`; identify caller/auth model; document source hash/version and any behavior difference. |
| A2 | `import-vimeo-training`, `admin-change-password`, `record-completed-audit`, `validate-ai-assist` | Pending | Same capture/compare process. Preserve explicit custom authentication where present. |
| A3 | `generate-audit-report`, `create-client-audit`, `export-pdp-audit-pack` | Pending | Capture exact source and map direct UI callers. Do **not** narrow `create-client-audit` until Carl decides which Vivacity roles may create cross-tenant audits. Flag CORS/auth remediation separately. |
| A4 | `tmp-backfill-sharepoint-drive-ids`, `academy-fetch-vimeo-showcase` | Pending | Capture exact source and establish whether each is an active supported operation or an already-retired stub. Do not make lifecycle changes based only on repository absence. |

## Carl decisions / workflow checks needed

| ID | Decision or check | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | Which Vivacity roles may create a client audit for a different tenant? | Determines the safe replacement for `create-client-audit`'s broad non-empty-role check. |
| U2 | Exercise/identify the operator entry points for `test-mailgun` and `academy-backfill-course-thumbnails`. | A quiet log window and no tracked UI call cannot prove a manual workflow is retired. |
| U3 | Explicitly approve any PR merge after its checks and review are complete. | Repository rule: never merge to `main` without fresh in-session approval. |
| U4 | Complete any Supabase dashboard/provider actions identified in C5. | These settings cannot be safely changed through repository code alone. |

## Definition of done

1. Every deployed function has a source-controlled home, an explicit current
   410 retirement record, or a documented external ownership exception.
2. Each active privileged function has a verified caller/permission model and
   request-aware CORS.
3. No retirement or authorization narrowing caused a confirmed workflow
   regression.
4. Each production change is traceable to a merged PR, deployed source version,
   and audit entry.
